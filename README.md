## Project Overview

**Matcha** is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate social connections, featuring real-time chat, user profiles, event management, notifications, and more. The project is architected with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and infrastructure layers, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

  - Real-time communication via WebSockets for chat and notifications.
  - Modular structure with Controllers, Models, Middlewares, Schemas, and Utilities.
  - Data validation and security best practices (e.g., password hashing, input validation).
  - Fixture loading for development and testing.
- **Directory:** `Backend/`

### Frontend

- **Stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Router, Socket.IO client.
